<img src="images/loan.jpg" width ="500">

## Description

This is my project on SBA Loan Data. It provides for two predictive analytics models created following CRISP-DM methodology. One predicts loan repayment with a classification model and the other predicts job creation as a regression model.

## Executive Summary

This [video](https://youtu.be/G62wqCy5P1Y) was completed a few weeks before the end of the project.

## Final Report

The final [report](docs/FinalReport.pdf) and [video](https://youtu.be/6TPM5XNQz30) on predictive analytics for the Small Business Administration data set.

## Code

The [Exploratory Data Analysis](https://sdloyd.github.io/SBALoan/eda/630Project.html) was performed in R and can be downloaded from [here](eda/630Project.R).

The primary [code](code/FinalProject.ipynb) in Python using Jupyter Notebook.
