# Small Business Administration (SBA) Loan Data Set

<img src="images/loan.jpg" width ="500">

## Description

This is my project on SBA Loan Data. It provides for two predictive analytics models created following CRISP-DM methodology. One predicts loan repayment with a classification model and the other predicts job creation as a regression model. This was my first project using PyCaret for model selection and parameter tuning.

## Data

The Kaggle [data](https://www.kaggle.com/larsen0966/sba-loans-case-data-set) provided by [Data-Science Sean](https://www.kaggle.com/larsen0966).

## Executive Summary

This [video](https://youtu.be/G62wqCy5P1Y) was completed a few weeks before the end of the project.

## Final Report

The final [report](docs/FinalReport.pdf) and [video](https://youtu.be/6TPM5XNQz30) on predictive analytics for the Small Business Administration data set.

## EDA 

A pandas-profiling [report](https://sdloyd.github.io/SBALoan/pandasprofile/sba-pandas-profile-report.html) is available.

## Code

The [Exploratory Data Analysis](https://sdloyd.github.io/SBALoan/eda/630Project.html) was performed in R and can be downloaded from [here](eda/630Project.R).

The primary [code](code/FinalProject.ipynb) in Python using Jupyter Notebook.

If you have trouble with GitHub rendering the file, please try [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/SDLoyd/SBALoan/blob/main/code/FinalProject.ipynb).

The supporting code for model selection and parameter tuning also in Python using Jupyter Notebook:

## Instructions

To run this notebook locally, install Jupyter, download the data set, change the file location to load the code and data, and install all the library dependencies.

The R code is best run from RStudio. You will also need to download the code and data.

[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) can be used for both.

## Tools

* R
* R Studio
* Python
* PyCaret
* Jupyter Notebook
