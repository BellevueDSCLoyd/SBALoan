# Small Business Administration (SBA) Loan Data Set

<img src="images/loan.jpg" width ="500">

This is my project on SBA Loan Data. It provides for two predictive analytics models. One predicts loan repayment with a classification model and the other predicts job creation as a regression model.

## Executive Summary

This [video](https://youtu.be/G62wqCy5P1Y) was completed a few weeks before the end of the project.

## Final Report

The final [report](https://github.com/BellevueDSCLoyd/DSC630/blob/main/FinalReport.pdf) and [video](https://youtu.be/6TPM5XNQz30) on predictive analytics for the Small Business Administration data set.

## 

The Exploratory Data Analysis was performed in R.
