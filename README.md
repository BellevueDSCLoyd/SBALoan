## Description

This is my project on SBA Loan Data. It provides for two predictive analytics models. One predicts loan repayment with a classification model and the other predicts job creation as a regression model.

## Executive Summary

This [video](https://youtu.be/G62wqCy5P1Y) was completed a few weeks before the end of the project.

## Final Report
